Component-based software development proposes sound engineering principles and
techniques to cope with the complexity of present-day software
systems. However, many challenging conceptual and technological issues remain
in component-based software development theory and practice. Furthermore, the
advent of service-oriented and cloud computing, cyber-physical systems, and
the Internet of Things has brought to the fore new dimensions, such as quality
of service and robustness to withstand faults, which require revisiting
established concepts and developing new ones.

FACS 2019 is concerned with how formal methods can be applied to
component-based software and system development. Formal methods have provided
foundations for component-based software through research on mathematical
models for components, composition and adaptation, and rigorous approaches to
verification, deployment, testing, and certification.
