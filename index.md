### About protests in Peru.
 
We are continuously monitoring the political situation in Peru, which faced violent protests in 2022 also affecting travelers. To the best of our knowledge, this situation has calmed down. If protests erupt again, we will work closely with the ICTAC Steering Committee to choose the best feasible solution.

# About ICTAC

The International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects of Computing ([ICTAC](https://ictac.isp.uni-luebeck.de/about){:target="_blank"}) was founded in 2004. It takes place every year preferably in a developing country. The aim of the colloquium is to bring together practitioners and researchers from academia, industry and government to present research results, and exchange experience, ideas, and solutions for their problems in theoretical aspects of computing. Beyond these scholarly goals, another main purpose of the conference is to promote cooperation in research and education between participants and their institutions, from developing and industrial countries.
