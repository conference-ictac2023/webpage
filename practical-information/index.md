# Traveling to Lima

Flights to Lima arrive at [Jorge Chavez International Airport](https://www.lima-airport.com/en/){:target="_blank"} in [Callao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callao){:target="_blank"} district, which is around 17km to 25km to Barranco and Miraflores. Several international airlines operate regular direct or connecting flights to Lima's airport from many cities in the world.
In addition to local fights, there are various intercity buses that run along the Pan American Highway (Panamericana), which is Peru's only international highway running from north to south along the coastline of Peru. The Central Highway runs from east to west and links the Peruvian highlands with Lima. 

# From the Airport to Miraflores and Barranco

The best way to reach Miraflores and Barranco from the airport is via [authorized taxis located inside the airport](https://www.lima-airport.com/en/cms/pasajeros/transport/taxis){:target="_blank"}. Please be aware that Callao district is not touristic, therefore it is strongly advised to use the transport recommended by the airport.

# Get Around in Lima

Taxis are relatively inexpensive and a popular way to get around in Lima. However, be aware of fake taxi companies. Public transportation in Lima comprises a chaotic system, except for the Metropolitano, which is a new public transport system in Lima that was inaugurated in 2010. They connect various districts including Barranco and Miraflores. The fares are very cheap, however, expect to queue to enter the buses.
