- Languages and automata
- Semantics of programming languages
- Logic in computer science
- Lambda calculus, type theory, and category theory
- Domain-specific languages
- Theories of concurrency and mobility
- Theories of distributed computing

- Security and privacy
- Static analysis
- Software verification
- Software testing
- Program generation and transformation
- Model checking and theorem proving
- Theory and methods of trustworthy AI

# Submissions

  We solicit submissions, related to the topics of ICTAC, in the following categories:

  - __A__ - original research contributions;
  - __B__ - short papers, with original work in progress or with proposals of new ideas and emerging challenges; and
  - __C__ - tool papers on tools that support formal techniques for software	modeling, system design, and verification.

  Submissions must not exceed 16 pages (excluding bibliography of maximum 2 pages). Short and tool papers should not exceed 8 pages.

  Submissions must not have been published or be under consideration for
  publication elsewhere. All submissions will be judged on the basis
  of originality, contribution to the field, technical and presentation
  quality, and relevance to the conference’s topics.  

  All contributions to ICTAC 2023 have to be submitted electronically
  in PDF format via Easy Chair

  [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ictac20230](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ictac20230){:target="_blank"}

  Papers must be formatted according to the guidelines for Springer LNCS
  papers (see [http://www.springer.com/lncs](http://www.springer.com/lncs){:target="_blank"}), without modifications of margins
  and other space-saving measures. Authors should therefore consult Springer’s
  authors’ instructions and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX
  or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors
  to include their ORCIDs in their papers.

# Publication

  All accepted papers in categories A-C will appear in the proceedings of the
  conference that will be published as a volume in Springer’s Lecture Notes in
  Computer Science (LNCS) series.

  All accepted papers must be presented at the conference. Their authors must
  be prepared to sign a copyright transfer statement. At least one author of
  each accepted paper must register for the conference by the early registration
  date, and present the paper.

  A special journal issue is planned for extended versions of selected papers
  from ICTAC 2023.
