# Training School on Applied Formal Methods 

## About the  school

Formal Methods are logic-based techniques for the specification, development, and verification of systems.
They contribute to reliability and trustworthiness of systems and 
they deal with models of systems that capture their dynamic aspects (e.g., processes, transitions).

We plan to organize a training school on applied formal methods targeting master students, Ph.D. students, early-stage researchers, and lectures in the field of computer science and mathematics that want to get a taste of selected formal methods. The ICTAC training school will be held in Lima - Peru at UTEC, December 04-05, 2023.   

If you want to give a lecture on applied formal methods, please contact the general chairs of ICTAC 2023.
