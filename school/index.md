# Training School on Applied Formal Methods 

## About the  school

<a href = "https://www.fmeurope.org/formalmethods/" target="_blank"> Formal Methods </a> are logic-based techniques for the specification, development, and verification of systems.
They contribute to reliability and trustworthiness of systems and 
they deal with models of systems that capture their dynamic aspects (e.g., processes, transitions) and their properties (e.g, safety, liveness, fairness).

We plan to organize a training school on applied formal methods targeting master students, Ph.D. students, early-stage researchers, and lectures in the field of computer science and mathematics that are not familiar with formal methods and want to get a taste of what formal methods is. We plan to do so, via various lectures on selected formal methods. 

The ICTAC training school will be held in Lima - Peru at UTEC, December 04-05, 2023.   

If you want to give a lecture on applied formal methods, please contact the general chairs of ICTAC 2023.

         Marijn Heule is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. 
         His contributions to automated reasoning have enabled him and others to solve hard problems 
         in formal verification and mathematics. He has developed award-winning satisfiability (SAT) solvers. 
         His preprocessing and proof-producing techniques are used in many state-of-the-art automated reasoning tools. 
         Marijn won multiple best paper awards at international conferences, including at SAT, CADE, IJCAR, TACAS, HVC, 
         LPAR, and IJCAI-JAIR. He is one of the editors of the Handbook of Satisfiability. 
         This 1500+ page handbook (second edition) has become the reference for SAT research.

         <p><b>Bio:</b>  <br/>
         Ana Cavalcanti is a Professor at the University of York and a Royal Society - Wolfson Research Merit Award holder. 
          In 2003, she was awarded a Royal Society Industry Fellowship to work with QinetiQ on formal methods. 
          She has published more than 100 papers and chaired the Programme Committee of various well-established international conferences. 
          Her main research interest is the theory and practice of formal methods. She has a long-term interest in refinement, safety-critical systems, 
          object-orientation , concurrency, and real-time applications. She has played a major role in the design and formalization of a state-rich process 
          algebra, namely, Circus, and its development techniques using Hoare and He’s Unifying Theories of Programming.

        <p><b>Software Engineering for Robotics: RoboStar technology</b>  <br/> 
      The use of simulations to support the design of software for robotic systems is pervasive. 
      Typically, roboticists draw a state machine using an informal notation (not precise or machine-checkable) 
      to convey a design and guide the development of a simulation. This involves writing code for a specific simulator 
      (using C, C++, or some proprietary language and API). Reactive robotics simulators do not normally generate code for deployment. 
      Instead, simulation code is often reused after changes. So, there is a potential loss of properties observed via simulation: 
      because of the possibility of changes introducing errors, and because of the reality gap. 
      The <a href="https://robostar.cs.york.ac.uk/" target="_blank"> RoboStar </a> technology supports a model-based, rather than (simulation) code, 
      approach to development. Models are written using domain-specific notations in line with those accepted by roboticists. 
       In this lecture, we will focus on modelling and verification using RoboChart, our design notation, and its tool. In <a href="https://robostar.cs.york.ac.uk/robotool/" target="_blank">RoboChart</a>, software controllers are described by timed state machines. The semantics is defined using a process algebra, namely, <a href="https://robostar.cs.york.ac.uk/assets/tick-tock-report.pdf" target="_blank"> tock-CSP</a>, which we use for verification.
