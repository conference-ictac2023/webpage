# ICTAC 2023 Training School on Applied Formal Methods 

## About the  school

<a href = "https://www.fmeurope.org/formalmethods/" target="_blank"> Formal Methods </a> are logic-based techniques for the specification, development, and verification of systems.
They contribute to the reliability and trustworthiness of systems and 
they deal with models of systems that capture their dynamic aspects (e.g., processes, transitions) and their properties (e.g, safety, liveness, fairness).

The ICTAC training school on applied formal methods will be held in Lima - Peru at UTEC, December 04-05, 2023 and it targets master students, Ph.D. students, early-stage researchers, and lectures in the field of computer science and mathematics that are not familiar with formal methods and want to get a taste of what formal methods is. We plan to do so, via various lectures on selected formal methods. 

<b>There is a limited number of free registrations and a limited number of registrations with a minimum payment for Peruvian residents/citizens. </b> Please contact Cristian Lopez del Alamo (clopezd@utec.edu.pe) for further information.

        <p><b>Name:</b> Pedro R. D'Argenio <br/>
        <b>Affiliation:</b> National University of Córdoba, Argentina <br/>
        <b>Homepage:</b> <a href="https://cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~dargenio/" target="_blank">https://cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~dargenio/</a> <br/> </p> 
        <p><b>Bio:</b> <br/>
         Pedro R. D'Argenio is a Full Professor in Computer Science at FAMAF, National University of Córdoba. 
         He also holds a research post at CONICET.  He studied computer science at the National University of La Plata (Argentina), 
         and obtained his Ph.D. at the University of Twente (Netherlands) where he also did his postdoc.  He has also worked at the Université de 
         Provence (FR), and was Visiting Professor at the University of Twente (NL) and Saarland University (DE). 
         He is a former Director of the Doctoral Program in Computer Science and former Associate Dean of Science and Technology at FAMAF, UNC.  
         He is currently the Chair of the IFIP WG 1.8 on Concurrency Theory. 
         Prof. D'Argenio is a leading researcher in formal techniques for dependable systems, contributing in areas such as model checking, 
         process semantics, fault tolerance, security, and testing. He has led and participated in numerous Argentine and European research projects. <br/> </p> 
        <p><b>Probabilistic Model Checking. </b> <br/> 
          Model checking is a powerful tool to verify automatically if a model satisfies a given property. They normally provide a Boolean answer to a
          qualitative question. However, probabilistic features normally appear in systems of usually crucial characteristics.  
          For example, it is common to use randomized protocols to solve contention situations in networks or to understand fault models through the 
          stochastic behaviors of faults.  In this last case, for instance, the statement "the system does not fail" might be impossible to verify 
          while rather the appropriate question could be "99% of the time the system does not fail".
          In this tutorial, we will introduce the fundamentals and algorithms to address the verification of this type of quantitative properties.  
          In particular, we will discuss the verification of quantitative and qualitative properties on discrete-time Markov chains as well as on 
          the more versatile setting of Markov decision process.

        <p><b>The Theory and Practice of Runtime Verification: <br/> A Hand-On Introduction to the Formal Methods Technique with Applications in Cyber Security Monitoring</b> <br/> 
        Runtime verification is a lightweight formal methods technique that synthesizes executable monitors from unambiguous behavior descriptions.
        Such monitors are then automatically combined with the system under scrutiny to check its correctness at runtime. 
        Drawing on two decades of experience, this session will start by covering the theoretical bases of runtime verification, 
        particularly the specification and detection of any behavior violations at runtime. Next, we will have a hands-on session 
        where participants will be invited to try out Java and AspectJ code in their IDEs, using a financial transaction case study 
        (see <a href="https://github.com/ccol002/rv-book" target="_blank">https://github.com/ccol002/rv-book</a> if you are curious!).
        The last part of the session will focus on runtime verification in the context of cybersecurity; 
        showing how it can monitor the execution of security protocols, enforce isolation of a trusted execution environment, 
        and extract evidence that would otherwise be hard to obtain.

         <p><b>Bio:</b>  <br/>
         Marijn Heule is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. 
         His contributions to automated reasoning have enabled him and others to solve hard problems 
         in formal verification and mathematics. He has developed award-winning satisfiability (SAT) solvers. 
         His preprocessing and proof-producing techniques are used in many state-of-the-art automated reasoning tools.

         LPAR, and IJCAI-JAIR. He is one of the editors of the Handbook of Satisfiability. 
         This 1500+ page handbook (second edition) has become the reference for SAT research.
         <br/></p> 
        <p><b>Satisfiability Solving.</b> <br/>
         Satisfiability (SAT) solvers have become powerful search engines to solve a wide range of applications in fields such as formal verification, 
         planning, and mathematics. This lecture on SAT solving consists of two parts. The first part focuses on an introduction that ranges from many 
         applications of SAT to interesting theoretical aspects. It also covers basic solving techniques. 
         The second part provides hands-on experience on how to use SAT solvers in practice. This part consists of various examples, 
         such as how to encode a graph coloring problem into SAT and solving the resulting formula with a top-tier solver. 
         Additionally, we demonstrate some tools to make it easier to use SAT. We conclude by presenting satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) 
         solvers and how they can be used to solve problems.

        <p><b>Software Engineering for Robotics: RoboStar technology</b>  <br/> 
      The use of simulations to support the design of software for robotic systems is pervasive. 
      Typically, roboticists draw a state machine using an informal notation (not precise or machine-checkable) 
      to convey a design and guide the development of a simulation. This involves writing code for a specific simulator 
      (using C, C++, or some proprietary language and API). Reactive robotics simulators do not normally generate code for deployment. 
      Instead, simulation code is often reused after changes. So, there is a potential loss of properties observed via simulation: 
      because of the possibility of changes introducing errors, and because of the reality gap. 
      The <a href="https://robostar.cs.york.ac.uk/" target="_blank"> RoboStar </a> technology supports a model-based, rather than (simulation) code, 
      approach to development. Models are written using domain-specific notations in line with those accepted by roboticists. 
       In this lecture, we will focus on modelling and verification using RoboChart, our design notation, and its tool. In <a href="https://robostar.cs.york.ac.uk/robotool/" target="_blank">RoboChart</a>, software controllers are described by timed state machines. The semantics is defined using a process algebra, namely, <a href="https://robostar.cs.york.ac.uk/assets/tick-tock-report.pdf" target="_blank"> tock-CSP</a>, which we use for verification.
