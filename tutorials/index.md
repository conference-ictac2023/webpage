            <p><b>Bio:</b>  <br/> 
            Ina Schaefer is a full professor at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany, since April 2022 and heads the research group
            "Test, Validation, and Analysis of Software-Intensive Systems (TVA)" at the Institute for Information Security and Reliability (KASTEL). 
           Previously, she was a professor of Software Engineering and Automotive Informatics at the Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany, 
           for about ten years. She completed her doctorate in October 2008 at the TU Kaiserslautern, Germany. 
          Her postdoctoral period took her to Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, from September 2009 to October 2010. 
         The focus of her research is the integration of formal methods into software development, so that software can become better than it 
         currently is. She is particularly interested in aspects of scalability, modularity, and reusability. 
         Applications for this work can be found in a variety of systems, including automotive, aviation, and automation.

            <p><b>Bio:</b>  <br/>
        Maximilian Kodetzki is a PhD student at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany, since July 2023. 
       He is part of the research group "Test, Validation and Analysis of Software-Intensive Systems (TVA)" at the Institute for Information Security
       and Reliability (KASTEL). The focus of his research is the functional correctness of software product lines using formal methods. 
        Especially for safety-critical systems, the correctness is essential. Guaranteeing this correctness for product lines is difficult 
        due to the implemented variability and the exponential explosion of software products.

        <p><b>The Correctness-by-Construction Approach to Programming Using CorC </b> <br/>
         The Correctness-by-Construction tutorial focuses on an incremental programming approach to develop provable correct software. 
        The purpose of the tutorial is to influence the participants' approaches to algorithm development using a technique that balances 
        between formal methods and a "hack into correctness" style. 
        The tutorial features a step-by-step introduction to how to derive functional correct algorithms using small refinement rules. 
        Using carefully selected examples, the methodology can be applied by the participants in the tool WebCorC. 
        Further, the tutorial showcases practical demonstrations of how non-trivial algorithms can be successfully derived. 
        The tutorial bridges two extreme software development methodologies. On one side, approaches that are so formal that they even scare off 
        experienced theoretical computer scientists. On the other side, there are some who believe that formality is a waste of time 
        and develop software based on intuition and gut feelings. 
        Our aim is to guide the participants towards a middle ground, where software development is both rigorous and pragmatic, 
        but results in developing correct software.

        Mahsa Varshosaz is an assistant professor at IT University of Copenhagen. Her research is focused on quality assurance and safety of
        software systems. She is interested in both theoretical and practical aspects of modeling, testing, and verification of systems 
        and the challenges in the application of such techniques in different domains. 
        She has experience developing and applying modeling and model-based testing techniques for families of software systems. 
        More recently, she works on testing  underwater robotic systems in the REMARO ITN where she is vice-coordinator for the project.

        <p><b>Testing Cyber-Physical Systems: Synergizing Model and AI-based Approaches </b>   <br/> 
        One of the systematic and automated approaches for testing Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is through Model-Based Testing (MBT). 
        This method involves creating an abstract representation of a CPS, which is then utilized by an automated testing tool to generate 
        executable test cases. This process enables the CPS to be thoroughly and systematically tested. 
        Given the complexity of real-world CPS, there is a further need to optimize testing with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based approaches 
        such as genetic algorithms. This tutorial will have two main parts. 
        The first part will cover the basics of MBT and relevant AI-based approaches for test optimization. 
        The second part will present how these techniques are used to test real-world CPSs, such as communication systems, 
        automated warehouses, and robots.
