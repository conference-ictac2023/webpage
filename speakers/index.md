         <p><b>Bio:</b>  <br/>
         Marijn Heule is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. 
         His contributions to automated reasoning have enabled him and others to solve hard problems 
         in formal verification and mathematics. He has developed award-winning satisfiability (SAT) solvers. 
         His preprocessing and proof-producing techniques are used in many state-of-the-art automated reasoning tools. 
         Marijn won multiple best paper awards at international conferences, including at SAT, CADE, IJCAR, TACAS, HVC, 
         LPAR, and IJCAI-JAIR. He is one of the editors of the Handbook of Satisfiability. 
         This 1500+ page handbook (second edition) has become the reference for SAT research.

         <p><b>Bio:</b>  <br/>
         Ana Cavalcanti is a Professor at the University of York and a Royal Society - Wolfson Research Merit Award holder. 
          In 2003, she was awarded a Royal Society Industry Fellowship to work with QinetiQ on formal methods. 
          She has published more than 100 papers and chaired the Programme Committee of various well-established international conferences. 
          Her main research interest is the theory and practice of formal methods. She has a long-term interest in refinement, safety-critical systems, 
          object-orientation , concurrency, and real-time applications. She has played a major role in the design and formalization of a state-rich process 
          algebra, namely, Circus, and its development techniques using Hoare and He’s Unifying Theories of Programming.
